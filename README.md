# GSM-TV-Remote
The GSM module on the Arduino receives a text from the android app. The String will dictate what IR pulse is sent to the TV.

This was created to help my Mum and Auntie take care of my nan who is battling demetia and often forgets how to turn the Tv on.

Since my nan does not have internet at her flat the best/cheapest comunication method was to use the 2G network to send data (a text).
I bought a GSM hat for the arduino

and addeded a Vodafone sim (one of the last 2G carriers in the UK). There was a lot of online examples and documentaion which made it super easy to find the right power supply and debug some of the problems I faced.
